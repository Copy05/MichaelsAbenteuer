**Description**<br>
You are Michael a middle aged alcoholic dude that is taking on a adventure to find the Legendary **BEER** unfortunally he encounters fruits something he's allergic to.

**Arcade Type Game**<br>
It is endless. Michael is a alcoholic what'd you expect he is wandering drunk around there is no such thing as "Legendary **BEER**" How high can you bring your highscore?

**Why does this even exist**<br>
It all started back in 7th grade (6 Years ago) when i discovered a meme which displayed a playstation 4 game cover which features the german singer Michael Wendler and the text "Michaels Abenteuer". Me and the Boys laughted at it so much that i thought <i>"DAMN, i should make real game out of it"</i>. And so this exists. It originally started with the concept of Michael buying out the whole Beer stock of super markets. that was boring and written in C# what's better than a broken boring game than a **ARCADE GAME** about collecting beer

# Disclaimer

**If you think you encountered a bug or glitch. it is a intented feature. All unintentional bugs are of course patched!**<br>
This game is obviously satire. And should resemble a old flash game young people in my generation used to play

**Oh is it laggy?**<br>
Old Flash Games especially ran on Old Mashines were laggy too

Look what our nonsense talk about gaming turned into. We used to joke about a non existent game where it focuses about the word "the" being a Triple AAA Game. Guess what! It turned into reality with the release **OF THE BEST GAME OF THE CENTURY WE WANTED AND EXPECTED** (satire)<br>
- **Man the Game**<br>
Inspiring me that everything can be turned into a game even the word "The" or "The" The Game.<br>
